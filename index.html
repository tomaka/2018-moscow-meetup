# Why we need decentralized technologies

Examples: BitTorent, Bitcoin.

---

# How a decentralized system works

Three components:

- Discovery: we need to join the network.
- Publish-Subscribe (PubSub): subscribe to topics.
- Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

---

# Component #1: peers discovery

We need to discover machines that are part of the network and how to reach them.

Various methods:

- Discover nodes on the local network through mDNS and DNS-SD.
- The Internet is very large, so we need *bootstrap nodes*.
- Once connected to some nodes, they can report the other nodes they are connected to.

---

# Component #2: publish-subscribe

Propagate events through the network.

---

# Component #3: distributed hash table

A hash table, but each node stores only a subset of it.

---

# Introducing libp2p!

Libp2p is a library for decentralized applications.

- Specifications managed by Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai/).
- See also https://libp2p.io/

## Rust implementation

- Managed by Parity Tech (https://www.parity.io/).
- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p
- Still under development, but version 0.1 should be published on crates.io beginning of next year.
- Uses tokio for asynchronous networking.
- Used in practice by Substrate: https://www.parity.io/substrate/
- See the network in action: https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Krumme%20Lanke
- Likely to be used by Ethereum 2.0 and by a growing number of projects in the blockchains ecosystem.

# Live demonstration

*(assuming you have Cargo installed)*

Install demo chat application:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/tomaka/2018-rustrush-demo
```

Run it:

```sh
rustrush-demo
```

How it works:

- Uses mDNS to discover nodes on the local network.
- Maintains a connection to every single node it discovers.
- Broadcasts sent messages to all the nodes it is connected to.

**Warning**: Rust-libp2p has never been tested at a scale of more than ~80 nodes. May or may not
work.
