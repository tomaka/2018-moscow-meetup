# Rust libp2p state of the implementation

https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p

---

# Why the Rust programming language?

- Efficient but readable.
- Strict types and strict ownership system.
- Precise control over resources and resource use.
- Can write bindings into Rust from other languages.

# Characteristics of rust-libp2p

- Based on the `futures` and `tokio` libraries for zero-cost user-space cooperative multitasking.
- Can compile to asm.js and run in the browser.

- API was designed to have the fewer runtime overhead possible, and is thus different than the
  JavaScript and Go equivalents.
- On the protocol level, should be compatible with the JS and Go implementations (modulo bugs or
  misunderstandings in the protocol).

# Usage at Parity Technologies

## Parity

*Parity is a client for the Ethereum blockchain.*

- Support for libp2p (in parallel to the current layer) currently being added in parallel.
- Medium-term objective is to run Parity in a browser, which becomes possible with libp2p-websocket.
- In the long term future, the Ethereum community may decide to make the switch to libp2p.

## Polkadot

*Polkadot is a next generation blockchain to be launched in 2019.*

- Will be the primary networking layer of Polkadot.
